# Shortest Path Calculator 
## About
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem that involves finding the shortest route that visits each city (or province, in this context) exactly once and returns to the starting city. This project utilizes the brute force algorithm to solve the TSP, aiming to find an optimal path for visiting multiple provinces in Canada.
